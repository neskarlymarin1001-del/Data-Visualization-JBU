## Project Overview

This repository contains two RevealJS presentations developed for *Data Visualization (DAT-4313-01)* at John Brown University.  

The objective of this assignment was to apply core visualization principles to both cross-sectional and time-series datasets, emphasizing:

- Selecting the appropriate chart for each research question  
- Using proportions versus counts correctly  
- Applying logarithmic scaling for skewed data  
- Using faceting to improve clarity  
- Communicating insights clearly and professionally

## Presentations Included

### Customer Retail Analysis (Cross-Sectional)

**Dataset:** `customer_retail.RData`

This presentation analyzes customer demographics, spending behavior, and marketing responsiveness.  

Visualizations include:

- Proportion stacked bar charts  
- Boxplots with logarithmic scaling  
- Scaled density plots  
- Scatterplots with LOESS smoothing  

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in customer behavior while demonstrating best practices in data visualization.

### Penn World Table Analysis (Time-Series)

**Dataset:** `pwt_data.RData`

This presentation examines global economic trends from 1970–2019, including:

- GDP per capita growth comparisons  
- Human capital development over time  

The visualizations demonstrate:

- Multi-country time-series comparisons  
- Log-scaled growth trends  
- Faceted trend analysis  
- Contextual annotations  

These charts highlight differences in long-run economic development across advanced and emerging economies.
