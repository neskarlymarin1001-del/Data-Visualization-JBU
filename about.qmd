## About this Site

This site presents my work for **LAB 3.1 and LAB 3.2** for the Data Visualization course at John Brown University, which focus on exploratory data visualization using the **FIFA dataset** from the `datasetsICR` package.

In **LAB 3.1**, I analyze the relationship between **penalty ratings** and **weekly wages** for players at **Manchester United**, using **Preferred Foot** as a categorical variable. The lab includes data preparation, summary statistics, categorical tables, and multiple chart versions leading to a final visualization that meets all required design elements.

In **LAB 3.2**, I incorporate **peer feedback** to revise and improve the original visualization. This section presents a **before-and-after comparison**, highlighting how design choices such as trend lines, selective labeling, and improved visual hierarchy enhance interpretability and communication.

Together, these labs demonstrate the process of moving from an initial exploratory chart to a more polished and effective data visualization.
